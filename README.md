Hey - I hope you read this before much else happens.
Not sure how familiar you are with the GIT-flow model (Ive already kinda set it up),
but if you're going to make changes, either do them in dev, or make a new branch and
do it there. That way if we screw something up really badly, we can just revert to the
master branch.
